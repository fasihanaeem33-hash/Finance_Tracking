**Overview**
While building the Streamlit personal finance tracking app, I learned how to manage and organize financial data using Python,
Streamlit components, and simple data structures like lists and dictionaries. I understood how to create an interactive interface 
where users can input income, expenses, and investments, and instantly see summaries or visualizations. I also learned how powerful
Streamlit is for quickly turning Python scripts into user-friendly applications without complex front-end coding. Overall, this project
helped me strengthen my skills in data handling, UI design, and real-time financial tracking.
